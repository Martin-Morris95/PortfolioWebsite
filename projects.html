              This is a website I created for a landscaping business located in Brisbane. The
              client wanted a simple one page design that was also mobile friendly. I used this

            <p>
              This is the begining stages on a project to redevelop my works
              intranet. It is a proof of concept showcasing new features to be
              voted on and approved before full development takes place
            </p>

            <p>
              I wanted to add personalisation to the new intranet and
              therefore gave employees a customisable widget panel which they
              can fill with there most used tools/gadgets. I also allow
              employees to pick a colour scheme that best suits them. The goal
              is to make the intranet more useful and pleasent to use as our
              current site acts primarily as a document library/blog.

            <p>
              This is a website I created for a small clothing store located
              in Canungra called Holli Dolli. I used Shopify as the site
              needed to be made quickly and this also avoided reinventing the
              wheel if I was to go ahead and create my own cart system.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was pleased to find that shopify allowed me to create pages
              for the site in vanilla html/css/js and therefore gave me
              greater creative control over the custom pages (such as the
              about page).

            <p>
              My portfolio site was by far the most enjoyable to make. I set
              out to include as many libraries and plugins as I could. I did
              this not only to showcase my proficiency in such technologies
              but to primarily make my website more engaging and interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially my home page was a static image quite like the one you
              see now, I found this quite boring as it lacked any form of
              ‘Wow’ factor.
              <i>(If you haven’t found the hidden feature on the home page yet
                go and try clicking around or dragging the white dots)</i>. I therefore added a hidden dynamic
              background using the p5.js
              library (which I had never used before) to make my site more
              engaging whilst also showcasing my technical ability to learn
              new libraries from scratch.

              This is a site I created for Tamborine Driving School when I
              just started website development and was the first website I
              created for a business. I created the website in Wix (website
              builder) due to the time constraint and needs of the customer. I
              did have plans to recreate the site with vanilla html/css/js,
              however the website hosting fees end up costing more than the
              Wix subscription and therefore will be left alone

                  Pannellum is a lightweight, free, and open source panorama viewer for the web. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and WebGL, it is plug-in free. 
                  <a href="https://pannellum.org/" target="_blank">(https://pannellum.org/)</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was tasked to create a user-friendly workflow to allow employees to create interactive panoramic walkthrough by leveraging the power of the open 
                  source software Pannellum. The current workflow would mean manually altering code to place way points and to target the 360-degree render output 
                  images of the projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                 I thought this process would be too cumbersome for our small IT team, so I set out to create a web application to generate the code automatically. 
                 The web application I created allowed employees to upload there renders and allow them to place waypoints to other rooms. I then extended the 
                 experience by allowing a floor plan quick travel option.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The experiences then are assigned a unique link and hosted on the company’s web server allowing employees to send out the links for marketing purposes
                   or to their employees to embed on their websites as the tool also allows easy generation of Iframe code.

                This was the first application I made upon starting my new job
                as an IT Support Officer. The idea came about when I was being
                trained alongside another employee. As you could expect each
                of us had many questions and we would write down the answers
                in our notebooks. This became messy quickly and made finding
                the answers to problems a lengthy process. We also began
                asking the same questions repeatedly as we both worked
                different days.
              </p>
              <p>
                I realised we needed an efficient way to compile our
                knowledge, allow us to share notes, tips and tricks whilst
                storing them securely so the tool can be used by future new
                employees giving the company an easier way to train my role
                for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created the application in Visual studio using C# and WPF.
                The application allows users to generate a note template
                (which opens word automatically), they then add searchable
                tags and a description and then upload it to the database. All
                the IT team can then open the app and search for that note.

                  After two years in my role I decided to redo the Help Desk
                  Notes from scratch. This time utilizing my New found
                  knowledge and experience. I believe the difference between
                  the versions perfectly showcases how my skills have
                  developed and improved since first starting my role.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most notable upgrade to the tool is the ability to now
                  edit the notes. This was a feature I wanted to add for quite
                  soemtime however just couldnt find the time to implement it.
                  This now allows the notes to stay up to date and using a
                  much less tedious process which used to conist of removing
                  the notes from the database manually and then reuploading
                  the revised version.

                Disclaimer: I only worked on the front end of this project.
                All data gathering logic, utility password generation and
                signature update was done prior to my contribution to the
                project
              </i>
              <p>
                The system info tool was initialy created to gather data for
                each computer user, RAM, GPU, CPU, etc. This allowed IT to
                compile a computer list that we could access and instantly
                know who was using which machine and its specs. The tool also
                displayed realtime CPU, RAM, and storage performance which
                allowed the support team to quickly see if a computer had any
                performance issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                After sometime working at the company that had created and
                deployed this tool I noticed that no one paid attention to the
                tool and I believed we could rework the front end to be more
                pleasent and engaging for employees whilst also maintaing the
                functionality the tool was intended for.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started off with removing all the data that the employees
                wouldnt want to see/care about and moved it to its own
                seperate window (see image 2). This freed up alot of space and
                made the tool less cluttered. I then emphasized important
                information such as the IP address, computer name and current
                user name as these are three things we mostly ask for when
                offering remote help via the phone. I then reworked the alert
                system banner (see Image 3) to be more obvious and eye
                catching. This is an attempt to stop users missing there
                password resets and temp drive erase dates. Lastly I added a
                whole new section labeled IT Help Desk. This section allows
                for an automated email template to be generated to send
                helpdesk tickets and also includes the help desks contact
                number. This was done in an attempt to lower the amount of
                direct calls the head of IT recieves for trivial helpdesk
                level jobs.
              </p>

              <p>
                As our employees tend to work remotely/out in the field
                expired passwords can become quite a hassle if they have not
                reset them prior to the lock out date. As this happens quite
                alot I incorporated a password expiry checker that will alert
                the user via an automated email 7 and 3 days prior to it
                expiring with instructions on how to do so. This along with
                the new and improved alert banner system I hope to lower the
                password lockout cases.

                <p>
                  This project was created to solve a problem we found in the
                  workplace. Employees would request work trips via email.
                  This meant the only records of the trip requests were easily
                  lost, not approved correctly or simply fogotten about. We
                  also faced the issue with a break down of communication
                  between booking staff as emails were sent to individuals and
                  not a group inbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I worked along side one of the booking staff to create this
                  web application to ensure it was tailored to their need. We
                  decided to seperate the application into several layers. All
                  employees could request travel this would then send an email
                  their manager which would prompt them to view the approve
                  Travel Section. The managers then had the choice to either
                  accept or deny the trip. If denied the process stops here
                  and the employee recieves an email with the reason for
                  denial. If approved an email is sent to the booking
                  employees prompting them to view the Booking Admin section.
                  Here the staff have access to all the details needed to book
                  the trip. Once booked they mark it as booked and the
                  employee recieves a confirmation email.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This was an extremly fun app to build. The entire request
                  travel section is dynamic and transforms and prompts the
                  employee depending on the input. The deployment of the app
                  also streamlined the entire process and allowed for data
                  analytics as now all travel requests were being tracked and
