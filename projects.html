                             development and was the first website I created for a business. I created the website 
                             in Wix (website builder) due to the time constraint and needs of the customer. I did 
                             have plans to recreate the site with vanilla html/css/js, however the website hosting 
                             fees end up costing more than the Wix subscription and therefore will be left alone</p>

                        <strong>[HTML/CSS/JS] [p5.js] [Pure.CSS] [JQuery] [LightBox.js] [Git Deployment] [Web hosting management]</strong>
                        
                        <p>My portfolio site was by far the most enjoyable to make. I set out to include as many libraries and plugins as I could. 
                            I did this not only to showcase my proficiency in such technologies but to primarily make my website more engaging and interesting.</p>

                        <p>Initially my home page was a static image quite like the one you see now, I found this quite boring as it lacked any form of 
                            ‘Wow’ factor. <i>(If you haven’t found the hidden feature on 
                                the home page yet go and try clicking around or dragging the white dots)</i>. I therefore added a hidden dynamic background using the p5.js 
                                library (which I had never used before) to make my site more engaging whilst also showcasing my technical ability to learn
                                    new libraries from scratch.

                             <strong>[HTML/CSS/JS] [UI/UX] [Shopify] </strong>
                             
                             <p>This is a website I created for a small clothing store located in Canungra called Holli Dolli. 
                                 I used Shopify as the site needed to be made quickly and this also avoided reinventing the wheel 
                                 if I was to go ahead and create my own cart system.
                                
                             </p>

                             <p>I was pleased to find that shopify allowed me to create pages for the site in vanilla html/css/js 
                                and therefore gave me greater creative control over the custom pages (such as the about page).

                        <p>This was the first application I made upon starting my new job as an IT Support Officer. 
                            The idea came about when I was being trained alongside another employee. As you could
                             expect each of us had many questions and we would write down the answers in our notebooks. 
                             This became messy quickly and made finding the answers to problems a lengthy process. 
                             We also began asking the same questions repeatedly as we both worked different days.</p>
                             <p>
                                I realised we needed an efficient way to compile our knowledge, allow us to share 
                                notes, tips and tricks whilst storing them securely so the tool can be used by 
                                future new employees giving the company an easier way to train my role for the future.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                    I created the application in Visual studio using C# and WPF. The application 
                                    allows users to generate a note template (which opens word automatically), they 
                                    then add searchable tags and a description and then upload it to the database. 
                                    All the IT team can then open the app and search for that note.

                            <p>This app was created whilst working at an Architecture firm were the staff were using 
                                    a program called Unifi. Unifi acted as a centralized  point to store Revit Families that could then be imported into projects
                                </p>
                                <p>The licencing contracts for the software were coming to an end and the company was not wanting to renew the lengthy lock in contract. 
                                    I was tasked to create a similar application with a strict timeline as the licences were soon to expire. I created a Beta version of my 
                                    Revit Tools within three days that allowed the Architects to continue there work whilst I continued to upgrade and maintain the software by
                                    pushing out patches via Group Policy
                                </p>
        
                                <p>
                                    As time went on employees began requesting additional features such as an Auto Save feature and an Admin upload panel. I ensured that the program
                                    would allow for such scale-ability  and therefore became a platform for any additional features the copmany may desire.

                                    <p>
                                            This project was created to solve a problem we found in the workplace. Employees would request work trips via email.
                                            This meant the only records of the trip requests were easily lost, not approved correctly or simply fogotten about. 
                                            We also faced the issue with a break down of communication between booking staff as emails were sent to individuals and not a group inbox.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I worked along side one of the booking staff to create this web application to ensure it was tailored to their need. We decided to 
                                            seperate the application into several layers. All employees could request travel this would then send an email their  
                                            manager which would prompt them to view the approve Travel Section. The managers then had the choice to either accept or deny the trip. If denied the
                                             process stops here and the employee recieves an email with the reason for denial. If approved an email is sent to the booking employees prompting them
                                            to view the Booking Admin section. Here the staff have access to all the details needed to book the trip. Once booked they mark it 
                                            as booked and the employee recieves a confirmation email.
                                        </p>
                
                                        <p>
                                            This was an extremly fun app to build. The entire request travel section is dynamic and transforms and prompts the employee
                                             depending on the input. The deployment of the app also streamlined the entire process and allowed for data analytics as now all travel
                                             requests were being tracked and stored.
                                        </p>

                                <p>A showreel created halfway through my last year of my Games Design Bachelor. Although it showcases some early work which is a bit "rough around the edges" I believe it is an important piece to showcase as it shows not only my work but also how I improved throughout my degree.</p>
